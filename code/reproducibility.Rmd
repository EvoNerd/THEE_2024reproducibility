# Introduction

The goal of this code is to teach students about reproducibility principles:

1. Annotate: explain what you're doing and _why_

    - using script headers and other Rmarkdown features (like this list!)
  
    - commenting your code
  
    - using meaningful & human-readable variable names

2. Automate: make your decisions explicit using code

    - use a scripting language to run your analyses
    
    - use find+replace to change variable names
    
    - automate the naming of your output files to include parameter values in the filename

3. Hoard: keep (almost) everything

    - store raw data *and* intermediate steps in data processing
  
    - store code *and* progress on code (i.e., use version control)
    
    - backup your work regularly (daily!)
    
    - note down the exact versions of software and packages

4. Share: provide access to your work

    - save versions using Git
  
    - use GitHub to upload the versions to their online server
  

# Run the code

This code multiplies the numbers from 1 to 10 by a constant then saves the output to a comma separated values (`.csv`) file.

```{r}
# a silly function to multiply the values from 1 to 10
get.multiples1to10 <- function(multiplier){
   numbers <- 1:10
   output <- multiplier*numbers
   return(output)
}

# set the parameter value
current_multiplier <- 3

# run the function
results <- get.multiples1to10(current_multiplier)
print(results)

# name the output file
filename <- paste("numbers_1_to_10--multiplier", current_multiplier,".csv")

# print results to output
write.csv(results, filename, row.names = FALSE)
```
