# THEE_2024reproducibility
Purpose: showcase reproducibility principles & GitHub for THEE research practical
 
# Introduction
A readme file is the first thing a collaborator will encounter when you share your project with them. Its purpose is to orient them to your project: brief but detailed!

Structure it from wide to narrow: Start with the title and a short description of the project's motivation/purpose. If you have main results, you can list them here. Then explain how the project can be installed (e.g., any required dependencies like R or RStudio (versions?), any required packages). Next describe how the files are structured in the repository (which files run the code?, where can they find the data?, etc.).

# How to install
You will need R and RStudio. Any newer version should work (I used R 4.3.3 and RStudio 2023.12.1). You will have to install some packages to for knit (TO DO: list which??).

# File structure
There is 1 code file (reproducibility.Rmd with its associated reproducibility.html file). There are also 2 pdf files with the lecture slides that I presented.

reproducibility.Rmd creates output files in the format "numbers_1_to_10--multiplier \d .csv" but these data files should go in their own data folder.

**To do: update file structure!!**
   - change code to save output files in their own dedicated folder
