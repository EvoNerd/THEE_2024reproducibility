# THEE_2024reproducibility
Purpose: showcase reproducibility principles & GitHub for THEE research practical
 
# Introduction
A readme file is the first thing a collaborator will encounter when you share your project with them. Its purpose is to orient them to your project: brief but detailed!

Structure it from wide to narrow: Start with the title and a short description of the project's motivation/purpose. If you have main results, you can list them here. Then explain how the project can be installed (e.g., any required dependencies like R or RStudio (versions?), any required packages). Next describe how the files are structured in the repository (which files run the code?, where can they find the data?, etc.).
